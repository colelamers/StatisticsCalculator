# StatisticsCalculator

To start off, there is virtually no documentation for this. I hope maybe one day I can modify this to be more object oriented as opposed to be strictly functional. I just needed something fast and worked so this is an "as is" project for the time being.

This a very poorly made but quickly whipped up statistics calculator I made in a Windows Forms app. I needed something to conduct calculations and functions for me, as well as display them with just simply entering in datasets and letting it do the hard thinking. I made this for my statistics class because I got really tired of calculating the same things over and over again when I could have a basic app do all that for me.
